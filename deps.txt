Dependencies
============

all_deps.txt is a list of *all* dependencies, updated automatically with
a pre-commit hook to `Devel::Dependencies`. This is a
manually-maintained list of the stuff you might not actually have. If
you've found that you needed something that wasn't listed here, let us
know, and we'll include it.
